### Hey there y'all! It's ur boi, Mike ðŸ‘‹:metal:

:guitar::musical_keyboard::musical_note::notes::camera:

I am a 21 yrs old IT student that loves to code and also passionate about playing music.
In my pastime, I play guitar, listen to music, watch anime, take pictures of the sky or get lost in time with YouTube.

Whilst everyone tells me that I am not funny, they must be wrong.:sunglasses:

I think I am handsome since I think that I am and my mama told me so. 

I am currently into listening to progressive music such as Plini, Intervals, Polyphia and Animals as Leaders.

While my comedic line always goes with "Stay at home lang sa bahay", I believe that to do is to be and to be is to do. 

If I had a girlfriend, I'd send her memes and tell her she memes a lot to me.

If I were to create a tinder account, my 10/10 would swipe right bio would be:
Single 
as pringle
Ready to mingle
With a sweet cringle
