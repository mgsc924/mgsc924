### Hey there y'all! It's ur boi, Mike ðŸ‘‹:metal:

:guitar::musical_keyboard::musical_note::notes::camera:

I am a 21 yrs old IT student that loves to code and also passionate about playing music. I think I am handsome since I think that I am and my mama told me so. 

Whilst everyone tells me that I am not funny, they must be wrong.:sunglasses:
While my comedic line always goes with "Stay at home lang sa bahay", I believe that to do is to be and to be is to do, doo bee doo bee doo. 
If I had a girlfriend, I'd send her memes and tell her she memes a lot to me.
If I were to create a tinder account, my 10/10 would swipe right bio would be:

Single 

as pringle

Ready to mingle

With a sweet cringle
